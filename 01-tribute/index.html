            <h3>Early Life and career</h3>
            <p>
                Fela was born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti on 15 October 1938 in Abeokuta, the modern-day capital of Ogun
                State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, then a city in the British Colony of Nigeria into an upper-middle-class
                family. His mother, Chief Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a feminist activist in the anti-colonial movement; his father,
                Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, an Anglican minister and school principal, was the first president of the
                Nigeria Union of Teachers. His brothers, Beko Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, both medical doctors, are well
                known in Nigeria. Fela is a first cousin to the Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, the first African
                to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.

                Fela attended Abeokuta Grammar School. Later he was sent to London in 1958 to study medicine but decided to study music
                instead at the Trinity College of Music, the trumpet being his preferred instrument. While there, he formed the band
                Koola Lobitos, playing a fusion of jazz and highlife. In 1960, Fela married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor,
                with whom he would have three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola). In 1963, Fela moved back to the newly independent
                Federation of Nigeria, re-formed Koola Lobitos and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting
                Corporation. He played for some time with Victor Olaiya and his All Stars.

                In 1967, he went to Ghana to think up a new musical direction. That was when Kuti first called his music
                Afrobeat. In 1969, Fela took the band to the United States where they spent 10 months in Los Angeles. While there,
                Fela discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now Sandra Izsadore), a partisan of the Black Panther
                Party. The experience would heavily influence his music and political views. He renamed the band Nigeria '70. Soon
                afterwards, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was tipped off by a promoter that Fela and his band were in the
                US without work permits. The band performed a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be released as
                The '69 Los Angeles Sessions.
