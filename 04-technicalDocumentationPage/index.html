                    <p>
                        A <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> (<strong>or crypto currency</strong>) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong
                        cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of
                        assets. They are prone to fraud and have operated under a "veneer of legitimacy".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrencies are a kind of alternative currency and digital currency (of which virtual currency is a subset).
                        Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain,
                        that serves as a public financial transaction database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized
                        cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, over 4,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other
                        cryptocurrencies) have been created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:
                        <ol class="numList">
                            <li>The system does not require a central authority, its state is maintained through distributed consensus.</li>
                            <li>The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.</li>
                            <li>The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created,
                                the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.</li>
                            <li>Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.</li>
                            <li>The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A
                                transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.</li>
                            <li>If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously
                                entered, the system performs at most one of them.</li>
                        </ol>
                        In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

                        The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in
                        many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, others have banned or restricted
                        it. According to the Library of Congress, an "absolute ban" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in eight
                        countries: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. An "implicit ban"
                        applies in another 15 countries, which include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia,
                        Iran, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. In the United States and Canada,
                        state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators
                        Association, are investigating "bitcoin scams" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoin differently. China Central Bank banned the
                        handling of bitcoins by financial institutions in China in early 2014.

                        In Russia, though cryptocurrencies are legal, it is illegal to actually purchase goods with any currency other than the
                        Russian ruble. Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems

                        Cryptocurrencies are a potential tool to evade economic sanctions for example against Russia, Iran, or Venezuela. In
                        April 2018, Russian and Iranian economic representatives met to discuss how to bypass the global SWIFT system through
                        decentralized blockchain technology. Russia also secretly supported Venezuela with the creation of the petro (El
                        Petro), a national cryptocurrency initiated by the Maduro government to obtain valuable oil revenues by circumventing
                        US sanctions.

                        In August 2018, the Bank of Thailand announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the Central Bank Digital
                        Currency (CBDC).

                        <h4>Advertising bans</h4>
                        Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency advertisements were temporarily banned on Facebook, Google, Twitter, Bing,
                        Snapchat, LinkedIn and MailChimp. Chinese internet platforms Baidu, Tencent, and Weibo have also prohibited bitcoin
                        advertisements. The Japanese platform Line and the Russian platform Yandex have similar prohibitions.

                        <h4>U.S. tax status</h4>
                        On 25 March 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for
                        tax purposes. This means bitcoin will be subject to capital gains tax. In a paper published by researchers from
                        Oxford and Warwick, it was shown that bitcoin has some characteristics more like the precious metals market than
                        traditional currencies, hence in agreement with the IRS decision even if based on different reasons

                        <h4>The legal concern of an unregulated global economy</h4>
                        As the popularity of and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009,[66] so have
                        concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to
                        society. Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade
                        taxes and launder money.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and
                        therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient
                        reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing
                        cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money. Rather than
                        laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts, laundering money through
                        altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions.
                    </p>

                        <h4>Loss, theft, and fraud</h4>
                        In February 2014 the world's largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, declared bankruptcy. The company stated that it had
                        lost nearly $473 million of their customers' bitcoins likely due to theft. This was equivalent to approximately 750,000
                        bitcoins, or about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in
                        December to under $400 in February.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two members of the Silk Road Task Force—a multi-agency federal task force that carried out the U.S. investigation of
                        Silk Road—seized bitcoins for their own use in the course of the investigation.[69] DEA agent Carl Mark Force IV, who
                        attempted to extort Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht ("Dread Pirate Roberts"), pleaded guilty to money laundering,
                        obstruction of justice, and extortion under color of official right, and was sentenced to 6.5 years in federal
                        prison.[69] U.S. Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges pleaded guilty to crimes relating to his diversion of $800,000
                        worth of bitcoins to his personal account during the investigation, and also separately pleaded guilty to money
                        laundering in connection with another cryptocurrency theft; he was sentenced to nearly eight years in federal
                        prison.

                        Homero Josh Garza, who founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a plea
                        agreement that the companies were part of a pyramid scheme, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2015. The U.S.
                        Securities and Exchange Commission separately brought a civil enforcement action against Garza, who was eventually
                        ordered to pay a judgment of $9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, through his
                        companies, had fraudulently sold "investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be
                        generated" from mining.

                        On 21 November 2017, the Tether cryptocurrency announced they were hacked, losing $31 million in USDT from their
                        primary wallet. The company has 'tagged' the stolen currency, hoping to 'lock' them in the hacker's wallet (making
                        them unspendable). Tether indicates that it is building a new core for its primary wallet in response to the attack in
                        order to prevent the stolen coins from being used.

                        In May 2018, Bitcoin Gold (and two other cryptocurrencies) were hit by a successful 51% hashing attack by an unknown
                        actor, in which exchanges lost estimated $18m. In June 2018, Korean exchange Coinrail was hacked, losing US$37
                        million worth of altcoin. Fear surrounding the hack was blamed for a $42 billion cryptocurrency market selloff. On
                        9 July 2018 the exchange Bancor had $23.5 million in cryptocurrency stolen.

                        The French regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) lists 15 websites of companies that solicit investment in

                        Properties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of
                        payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets, such
                        as Silk Road.[67] The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use
                        since then. In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased
                        from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000.

                        Darknet markets present challenges in regard to legality. Bitcoins and other forms of cryptocurrency used in dark
                        markets are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world. In the U.S., bitcoins are labelled as
                        "virtual assets". This type of ambiguous classification puts pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to
                        adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark markets.

                        <h4>Legality in Indonesia</h4>
                        Indonesia law No. 7 of 2011 about currency in Indonesia only allows Rupiah as a medium of exchange in Indonesia[78].
                        The law effectively prohibits the use of commodities such as cryptocurrencies and gold as currencies. Bank Indonesia
                        has emphasized the prohibition on using cryptocurrency assets as a medium of exchange in Indonesia.

                        Cryptocurrencies have been compared to Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes and economic bubbles, such as housing
                        market bubbles. Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management stated in 2017 that digital currencies were "nothing but
                        an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has
                        little or none beyond what people will pay for it", and compared them to the tulip mania (1637), South Sea Bubble
                        (1720), and dot-com bubble (1999).

                        While cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are managed through advanced encryption techniques, many governments
                        have taken a cautious approach toward them, fearing their lack of central control and the effects they could have on
                        financial security. Regulators in several countries have warned against cryptocurrency and some have taken concrete
                        regulatory measures to dissuade users. Additionally, many banks do not offer services for cryptocurrencies and can
                        refuse to offer services to virtual-currency companies. Gareth Murphy, a senior central banking officer has stated
                        "widespread use [of cryptocurrency] would also make it more difficult for statistical agencies to gather data on
                        economic activity, which are used by governments to steer the economy". He cautioned that virtual currencies pose a new
                        challenge to central banks' control over the important functions of monetary and exchange rate policy. While
                        traditional financial products have strong consumer protections in place, there is no intermediary with the power to
                        limit consumer losses if bitcoins are lost or stolen. One of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to
                        credit cards, for example, is consumer protection against fraud, such as chargebacks.

                        An enormous amount of energy goes into proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining, although cryptocurrency proponents claim it
                        is important to compare it to the consumption of the traditional financial system.

                        There are also purely technical elements to consider. For example, technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such
                        as bitcoin result in high up-front costs to miners in the form of specialized hardware and software. Cryptocurrency
                        transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction. Additionally, cryptocurrency
                        private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical
                        media. This prevents the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets

                        The cryptocurrency community refers to pre-mining, hidden launches, ICO or extreme rewards for the altcoin founders as
                        a deceptive practice. It can also be used as an inherent part of a cryptocurrency's design. Pre-mining means
                        currency is generated by the currency's founders prior to being released to the public.

                        Paul Krugman, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winner does not like bitcoin, has repeated numerous times that
                        it is a bubble that will not last and links it to Tulip mania. American business magnate Warren Buffett thinks
                        that cryptocurrency will come to a bad ending. In October 2017, BlackRock CEO Laurence D. Fink called bitcoin an
                        'index of money laundering'. <quote>"Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world,"</quote>
                        he said.

                        In September 2015, the establishment of the peer-reviewed academic journal Ledger (ISSN 2379-5980) was announced. It
                        covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh.

                    <p>
                        The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which will then be timestamped into
                        the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.
